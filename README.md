# Birmnigham CVD risk factor analysis

This study uses data drawn from the 5-year NHS health checks (HCs) rolling dashboard where checks were completed between 22/06/2018 and 30/06/2023 with n = 108,514 patient-record-level data. This is provided by the Midlands and Lancashire Clinical Support Unit (MLCSU) who extracted the General Practice (GP) data from Egton Medical Information Systems (EMIS) and The Phoenix Partnership (TPP) System One. Some West Birmingham GPs are not included as they fall under the Sandwell and West Birmingham ICB. 

Demographic trends are given for the following CVD risk factors:
 - Obesity
 - Alcohol consumption
 - Hypertension
 - Physical inactivity
 - Smoking
 - High cholesterol

We use an ethnicity-specific definition of BMI [as recommended by NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg189/chapter/Recommendations#identifying-and-assessing-overweight-obesity-and-central-adiposity:~:text=Classifying%20overweight%2C%20obesity%20and%20central%20adiposity%20in%20adults).
